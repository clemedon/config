"   @brief  Return the position of the next line matching the given pattern
"
"   This function is used to find the next line matching a given pattern within
"   the same paragraph (until the first emptyline encountered). It can be used
"   to find a sibling task by passing it a pattern that identify this task.
"
"   @param  from_line     The line number to start searching from
"   @param  to_pattern    The pattern to search for (regex)
"   @param  abort_pattern Pattern that abort the searching encountered (regex)
"   @param  step          Step size for searching, can be negative.
"   @return The line number of the next matching line, or 0 if no match is found
"
"   @note   Don't forget that if the pattern match the current line, this one
"           will be returned.
